<ins>Abstract</ins>: A computer simulation tracking the motions and interactions of neutrons within pure samples of fissile material was developed and programmed in Python. The simulation used Monte Carlo methods to generate random numbers which determined neutron direction and distance of travel, as well as the type of interaction to undergo. The Python programme involved a non constant time step and the development of a subsequent system of ordering events in the simulation. Results from the simulation were then used in order to characterise chain reactions in the samples, and ultimately obtain values for the critical masses of Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239.
